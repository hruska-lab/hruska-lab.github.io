Research lab investigating drug-protein interactions and drug metabolism with the help of high-throughput atomistic simulation and machine learning. 
<br>
Located at [Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University](https://portal.faf.cuni.cz/Profile/Hruska-Eugen/) in [Hradec Králové, Czech Republic.](https://en.mapy.cz/zakladni?source=firm&id=360719&ds=2&x=15.8358164&y=50.2015221&z=5)

#### Open PhD position
The determination of drug metabolism is a critical step in drug development. While in silico prediction of drug metabolism is promising, currently it is limited by frequent false positives. The goal of this work is to improve high-throughput prediction of chemical reactions during drug metabolism. The methods will focus on machine learning and atomistic simulation.
